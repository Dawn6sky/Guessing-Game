# Guessing-Game
A guessing game dedicated to my friend using C++.

Hi! Thanks for stopping by. This actually a game created as a surprise birthday gift for my best friend. Though I changed some words before uploading it to protect her privacy.

After running the code, the user will be asked a few question and in the end there will be a secret code needed to be solved. 

Finally, after the user solved it and pm me the answer, I will give her a final file, a .pdf file which is my note for her. I didn't share it in the respiratory because it contains some personal information.

Another idea I got afterwards is to give the .cpp file and .pdf file at the same time, with the .pdf file as password-protected. The secret code will then be changed and act as the password to the .pdf file. If you guys want to try it feel free to do so.
